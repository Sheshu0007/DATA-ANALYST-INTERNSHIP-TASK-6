# DATA-ANALYST-INTERNSHIP-TASK-6
# üìä Online Sales Database -- README

This project demonstrates how to create and analyze an **online sales
dataset** using MySQL. It includes table creation, schema modifications,
and analytical queries for revenue, transactions, and sales insights.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üóÑÔ∏è Database & Table Setup

``` sql
-- Select database
USE online_sales;

-- Create table
CREATE TABLE `tableName` (
    `Transaction ID` INT,
    `Date` VARCHAR(512),
    `Product Category` VARCHAR(512),
    `Product Name` VARCHAR(512),
    `Units Sold` VARCHAR(512),
    `Unit Price` DOUBLE,
    `Total Revenue` DOUBLE,
    `Region` VARCHAR(512),
    `Payment Method` VARCHAR(512)
);
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üìå Table Rename & Data Selection

``` sql
-- Rename table
RENAME TABLE sales TO saless;

-- View all records
SELECT * FROM saless;
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üîç Data Cleaning & Null Check

``` sql
-- Check for null values in revenue
SELECT * 
FROM saless
WHERE total_revenue IS NULL;

-- View dates
SELECT Date 
FROM saless;

-- Change column type for Date
ALTER TABLE saless
MODIFY date DATE;
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üìä Transaction Analysis

### 1. Transaction List by Month

``` sql
SELECT `date`, MONTH(`date`) AS month, transactionid
FROM saless;
```

### 2. Total Revenue by Month

``` sql
SELECT SUM(total_revenue) AS total_revenue, MONTH(`date`) AS months
FROM saless
GROUP BY MONTH(`date`);
```

### 3. Total Revenue by Year

``` sql
SELECT SUM(total_revenue) AS total_revenue, YEAR(`date`) AS year
FROM saless
GROUP BY YEAR(`date`);
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üõ†Ô∏è Table Modification

``` sql
-- Rename column
ALTER TABLE saless
CHANGE `Transaction ID` transactionid INT NOT NULL;
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üìà Sales & Revenue Insights

### 1. Count of Transactions & Sales per Month

``` sql
SELECT DISTINCT MONTH(date) AS month, COUNT(transactionid), SUM(total_Revenue) AS revenue
FROM saless
GROUP BY MONTH(date);
```

### 2. Average Sales by Month

``` sql
SELECT MONTH(date) AS month, AVG(total_revenue) AS Average_Sales
FROM saless
GROUP BY MONTH(date);
```

### 3. Sum of Sales by Month

``` sql
SELECT MONTHNAME(date) AS month, SUM(total_revenue) AS sum_sales
FROM saless
GROUP BY MONTHNAME(date);
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üìä Transaction Counts

``` sql
-- Total transactions overall
SELECT DISTINCT COUNT(transactionid) 
FROM saless;

-- Total sales records
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM saless;

-- Distinct transaction count
SELECT DISTINCT COUNT(transactionid) 
FROM saless;
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üèÜ Revenue Ranking

### Top 3 Months with Highest Revenue

``` sql
SELECT MONTHNAME(date) AS month, SUM(total_revenue) AS revenue
FROM saless
GROUP BY MONTHNAME(date)
ORDER BY SUM(total_revenue) DESC 
LIMIT 3;
```

### Top 3 Months with Lowest Revenue

``` sql
SELECT MONTHNAME(date) AS month, SUM(total_revenue) AS revenue
FROM saless
GROUP BY MONTHNAME(date)
ORDER BY SUM(total_revenue) ASC 
LIMIT 3;
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Null Value Recheck

``` sql
SELECT * 
FROM saless
WHERE total_revenue IS NULL;
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

‚úÖ This README helps track **table creation, cleaning, modifications,
and insights** for your `saless` table.

FROM saless
WHERE total_revenue IS NULL;



his project manages and analyzes an online sales dataset in MySQL. It includes creating a saless table with columns for transaction details, product information, sales, and region, followed by data cleaning such as checking for null values and converting the Date column to a proper DATE type. Column names with spaces were renamed for consistency, and queries were written to extract month and year information, calculate monthly and yearly total revenue, count transactions, compute average and total sales by month, and rank months by revenue performance. The project provides insights into sales trends, identifies high- and low-revenue months, and ensures the dataset is structured and clean for further analysis.
